# Generative Art Gallery

"Generative art gallery" is a bit pretentious, I know, but apparently this is how algorithmically generated colored stuff is called nowadays.
And I have to admit the name is pretty cool :D

This repository contains some experiments of generative arts in plain JavaScript/Canvas.
It has been bootstrapped with React to support other UI elements.
