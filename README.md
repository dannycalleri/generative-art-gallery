# Generative Art Gallery - [Demo](http://dannycalleri.github.io/generative-art-gallery)

"Generative art gallery" is a bit pretentious, I know, but apparently this is how algorithmically generated colored stuff is called nowadays.
And I have to admit the name is pretty cool :D

This repository contains some experiments of generative arts in plain JavaScript/Canvas.
It has been bootstrapped with React to support other UI elements.

Some of this examples have been inspired by the great stuff done by the folks at: https://generativeartistry.com/
